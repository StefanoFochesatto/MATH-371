\subsection*{Introduction}

Below are some data on violent crime in US States during the year
1973. This data set comes from {\tt R}, a free statistics software package
widely used by statisticians.

You are asked to compute some summary statistics, create boxplots
and histograms, and answer a few questions.  All of this work should 
be done with {\tt R} or {\tt RStudio}.  (Part of your grade is simply to complete
this lab using the software package {\tt R}.)
Information about the website where you can download {\tt R} and some
basic {\tt R} commands have been included at the end of this handout to help.  
After starting {\tt RStudio} and loading the data set {\tt USArrests}, type
{\tt help(USArrests)} to get some information about this dataset.

For submission to your instructor, write your answers in the space provided 
and hand in graphs.

\subsection*{Data}

\begin{verbatim}
Violent Crime Rates by US State

Description:

     This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000
     residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US
     states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living
     in urban areas.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the population under study?\\\\
The population under study is the 100,000 residents in each state during 1973.
\ifthenelse{\boolean{long}}{\vskip 2cm }{}

\item Compute the Min, Q1, Median, Q3, Max for the numerical variables
Murder and Rape.  Then compute the mean for these two variables.  Is
the mean bigger than, smaller than, or roughly equal to the median?
What does your answer here tell you about the variables Murder and
Rape.\\\\
\begin{equation}
Murder, 
\begin{bmatrix}
Min.&1st Qu.&Median&3rd Qu.&Max.\\ 
 0.800&4.075&7.250&11.250&17.400 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
Rape, 
\begin{bmatrix}
Min.&1st Qu.&Median&3rd Qu.&Max.\\ 
 7.30&415.07&20.10&26.18&46.00
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
Mean
\begin{bmatrix}
Murder&Rape\\ 
 7.788&21.23
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\
Comparing the mean of these two variable it becomes clear that in the U.S, rape occurs approximately 3 times as often. In comparison to the median for both variables the mean is a little larger but hardly so, this tells us that there are hardly no outliers if there are any at all.

\item Compute boxplots for the variables Murder and Rape.  Summarize what
you learn from viewing the boxplots for the two variables.  Plots of these boxplots
should be handed in with your lab.\\\\

The boxplot for Murder is rather short, which means that there isn't a great variation from state to state in the number of incidents. However the boxplot for Rape is the opposite, it's a lot taller and even has outliers(Alaska, and Nevada). In terms of distribution both boxplots are similar, they are both relatively even below and above the median

\ifthenelse{\boolean{long}}{\vskip 4cm }{}

\item Looking at the data for Alaska, how does it compare to other states?
Do you think Alaska is typical?  Can you think of any factors that
might explain the data for Alaska in comparison with the other
states?\\\\
\begin{equation}
Alaska
\begin{bmatrix}
Murder&Assault&UrbanPop&Rape\\ 
 10.0&263&48&44.45
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\
Alaska is in first quartile in UrbanPop but is in the third quartile in Murders, fourth quartile in Assault, and is second highest in rape. Definitely not typical, It would make sense that violent crime is committed at higher rates in more urban areas, yet the opposite is true for Alaska. It makes sense that the the urban population is so low, since Alaska even now, is somewhat underdeveloped and this data was taken back in 1973, only 14 years after it was made a state in 1959. It's possible that Alaska was seen as a sort of ""Wild West".

\item Make a frequency histogram for the numerical variable Rape.  Let each
bin be of size $5$, and have the range on the $x$-axis be from 0 to
50.  (This means your bins will be $[0,5], [5,10]$, etc.)  How many
states have between 15 and 20 rapes per 100,000 residents per year?
Write the {\tt R} command you used to plot this histogram in the space
below.\\\\

There are 12 states with between 15 and 20 rapes per 100,00 residents per year. The command used to build the histogram is,
\begin{equation}
 hist(Rape, xlim=c(0,50), breaks=10); 
\end{equation}

\ifthenelse{\boolean{long}}{\vskip 1cm }{}
      
\item Looking at the histogram for the variable Rape, can you tell if
the mean is bigger than the median?  Explain.\\\\
 Yes, because the histogram is skewed slightly to the right, which means that there are large data points that are driving the mean higher.

\ifthenelse{\boolean{long}}{\vskip 3cm }{}

\item Now load the data table in the file {\tt annual\_income} into
{\tt R} and compute the mean and median, and plot a histogram. 
Choose settings for the histogram to display the data in a `good'
light, and include a graph of this histogram with your completed
lab. 

Remove the largest test score and save it to a new variable called d.  Type

\hskip 1cm {\tt d = incomes[1:99]}

at the {\tt R} prompt to do this.  Explain the effect of removing the
largest test score on the mean and the median.\\\\
\begin{equation}
Incomes, 
\begin{bmatrix}
Mean&Median\\ 
 59734&51826
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\

\begin{equation}
d, 
\begin{bmatrix}
Mean&Median\\ 
 57913&51618
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\
When we remove the outlier the mean drops by 2000. However the median stays the same. This proves that skewed histograms will have a higher or lower mean depending on the direction of the skew.

{\tt R} and {\tt RStudio} are available over the internet.  The URL for the Comprehensive {\tt R}
Archive Network is

\centerline{\tt http://www.r-project.org/}

\noindent but a simple Google search will find you plenty of hits.
You will need to choose a mirror and download a
package appropriate for your operating system.  If you are not
familiar with downloading such a software package, see me during
office hours for help.

\noindent All commands should be typed in {\tt R}'s console window.
